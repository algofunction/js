Your task is to return an object which includes the count of food options selected by the developers on the meetup sign-up form..

For example, given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'C', 
    meal: 'vegetarian' },
  { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Liechtenstein', continent: 'Europe', age: 52, language: 'JavaScript', 
    meal: 'standard' },
*/



function orderFood(list) {
  var orders = {};
  list.forEach(d=>{
    if(orders[d.meal]) orders[d.meal]++;
    else orders[d.meal] = 1;
  });
  return orders;
}
